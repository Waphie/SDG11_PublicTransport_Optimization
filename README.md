# SDG11_PublicTransport_Optimization

# Optimizing Public Transport Routes for Sustainable Cities with AI

## Project Overview

This project addresses **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** by using machine learning to optimize public transport routes. Inefficient bus routes contribute to urban congestion and pollution. We apply **K-Means clustering** to group bus stops based on their geographic locations, helping transit authorities redesign more efficient routes.

## Features

- Clusters bus stops into optimized route groups
- Visualizes clusters with maps and charts
- Uses unsupervised learning for practical urban planning
- Considers ethical implications like fairness and privacy

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, folium

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib folium
